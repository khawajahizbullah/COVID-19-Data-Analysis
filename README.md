# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
Analysis of global COVID-19 trends using Python. This project explores confirmed cases, deaths, and Case Fatality Rates (CFR) across countries, with visualizations to highlight key patterns and insights.

<h3><b>📌 Project Overview</b></h3>

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to explore trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and Case Fatality Rates (CFR) across multiple countries. Using Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is cleaned, processed, and visualized to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

<h3><b>🎯 Objective</b></h3>

The objective of this project is to identify and visualize key trends in COVID-19 data, compare countries’ outbreak patterns, and demonstrate how data-driven analysis can inform public health decisions.

<h3><b>📊 Key Features</b></h3>

  Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns)

  Calculation of 7-day rolling averages to smooth short-term fluctuations

  Trend analysis by country (e.g., US, India, Pakistan, Italy)

  Case Fatality Rate (CFR) analysis over time

Visualization of:

  New cases and deaths over time

  Top 10 countries by new cases

  CFR trends and country comparisons

<h3><b>🛠️ Tools & Libraries</b></h3>

Python

  Pandas & NumPy – data wrangling

  Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

  Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis

<h3><b>📈 Results & Insights</b></h3>

Multiple waves of COVID-19 observed globally, with peaks varying by country

CFR generally declined over time, reflecting improved healthcare and vaccination coverage

Large, densely populated countries reported higher new case numbers

Data-driven monitoring provides actionable insights for public health decisions
